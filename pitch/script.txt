== What
Doctor@Home is a self-monitoring solution for stay-at-home Covid-19 patients.

It consists of three key elements:

- Monitoring at home 
Helps to optimize scarse resources for clinicians,
and improves the quality of life for patients.

- Data collection
Accessible, pro-active data collection, that works particilarly well for elderly people.

- Intelligent Triaging
A Machine Learning model for triaging that supports clinicians in the decision making.
e.g. if a patient needs to be visited or even transferred into the hospital.



== Why ("Home Monitoring")
Governments have started to hand out thousands of pulse oxyometers to stay-at-home patients diagnosed 
with Covid-19.

Clinicians however are expected to reach out to each patient at least three times a day
to check vital parameters, such as blood oxygen stauration (SPO2).

This approach would overload our healthcare systemsm, as we anticipate many thousands of infections over time.
Also we can't rely on patients to provide the responsible clinitian with updates multiple times a day.

The solution is to proactivly reach out to patients to gather health data frequently using automation (like a chatbot or interactive voice system).

Clinitians work with a patient overview dashboard.
They get instant alerts when a triage level changes or when there are any other reasons to check back with the patient.






== How ("Oxymeters")

Patients or authorized individuals can measure essential health parameters 
like blood oxygen stauration, pulse, respiratory rate and body temperature.



== Focus ("Elderly")

Currently we support calling the patient via phone and an interactive voice system.
This has proven to work especially well for elderly people.

DEMO
  - Login
  - Patient list with latest data
  - See details with chart for Patien John Doe
  - Additionally to automatically scheduled calls, 
  we can also trigger a call to the patient from here 
  - (Wait for the Phone call, enter a few numbers)

  - The data should update after the call, with the new values and triage level prediction.
  - And there will be notification to the clinician.

In Summary:
Doctor@Home can support Clinitians to closely monitor their Covid-19 patients that stay at home.
- The approach reduces workload from Clinitians and supports with the triage and emergency indicators
- It helps optimize scarce clinical resources and to reduce infection exposure
- Improves patients quality of life by being able to stay home with family
